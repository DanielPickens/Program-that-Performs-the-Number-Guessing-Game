# Program-that-Performs-the-Number-Guessing-Game
My code automates a Number Guessing game to be executed in a a new tab
 
 
To elarify:
With my specific program, it is reading a number between 1 and 100, using a designated ‘input’ variable. I added a nested "if else" condition statement that is being used to check the value of ‘input’ variable is equal to 0, if the condition is true then it will xecute the  if condition statement.

Otherwise, if the condition is false then the program will execute the elseif statement. Ive added paramteres which will check the condition that the value of ‘input’ variable is greater than the value of ‘randno’ variable. If the condition is true then it will execute the statement and print the statement as the value is "low  value try again". Decrement the value of ‘count’ variable.

Otherwise, if the condition is false then it will execute another elseif statement. Check the value of ‘input’ variable is greater than the value of ‘randno’ variable. If the condition is true then execute the elseif statement.

Ive added functions for  print on the statement as the value is "high value, try again"  and decrement the value of ‘count’ variable. Otherwise if the condition is false then it will go on ahead and execute the else statement and print the guessed number.

Thus  this makes for the Number Game in a new tab!
