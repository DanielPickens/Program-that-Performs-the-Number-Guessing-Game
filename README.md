# Program-that-Performs-the-Number-Guessing-Game
My code automates a Number Guessing game to be executed in a a new tab
 For my program, it is reading a number between 1 and 100, using ‘input’ variable. Nested if else condition statement is used to check the value of ‘input’ variable is equal to 0, if the condition is true then execute if condition statement.

Otherwise, if the condition is false then execute the elseif statement. Check the condition that the value of ‘input’ variable is greater than the value of ‘randno’ variable. If the condition is true then execute the statement and print the statement as the value is low try again. Decrement the value of ‘count’ variable.

Otherwise, if the condition is false then execute another elseif statement. Check the value of ‘input’ variable is greater than the value of ‘randno’ variable. If the condition is true then execute the elseif statement.

Print the statement as the value is high try again and decrement the value of ‘count’ variable. Otherwise if the condition is false then execute the else statement and print the guessed number.
